This is a standard div with the added functionality of resizing in each direction. All attributes of the div are passed down. Only width, height, and cursor style properties are overwritten inside the component. The rest of the styling parameters are up to you. To use it:
To use it:
 - npm i @sobierajb/resizable-div 
 - import ResizableDiv from "@sobierajb/resizable-div"

The component has two additional parameters:
- lockResize: This property disables resizing functionality.
- edgeSize: This property describes how big the detectable edge is.

Have fun ;)
